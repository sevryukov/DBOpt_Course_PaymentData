Correctness test of balance calculation

In order to test the correctness of the calculation, we verify the bank, supplier, customer and cashbox to compare
whether the value is correct by setting the initial and final balance.

Because of the large number of transactions, we cannot list them one by one. Here we only list four transactions.

Finally, we draw the initial and final balance of the bank, supplier, customer and cash box and print it. 
Bank initial balance: 0, Cashbox initial balance: 0, Client initial balance: 0, Supplier initial balance: 0.
Bank final balance: 32745, Cashbox final balance:-66600, Client final balance: -23386, Supplier final balance: -19281.
